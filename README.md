# hello-world
intro to github

To all who happen upon this,

I have embarked upon a voyage to learn to use GitHub. This is part of it.

As a separate matter, I have never had tacos on the Moon. I am not overtly troubled by this fact, though I would welcome the opportunity to partake in said tacos.

That about sums it up.
